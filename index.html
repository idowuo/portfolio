    <h2>MEDICAL APPS TO BE DEVELOPER</h2>
    <hr class="yellow" />
        <p class="bio">
        I trained in General Surgery at Loma Linda University, California. I completed my Pediatric Surgery Fellowship at Childrens Hospital Detroit, Michigan. I am board certified in General Surgery and in Pediatric Surgery. I am currently a full professor at University of California, San Francisco. My clinical interests include all aspects of general pediatric surgery, with interests in gastrointestinal surgery, pancreatic and splenic surgery and surgical repair of chest wall deformity. I have worked to develop surgical techniques that would improve operating procedures and outcome in pancrease and splenic surgical procedures. And more recently I developed a safer surgical technic for the correction of chest wall deformities My creative mind gave me a passion for medical device innovation because without it' is impossible to develop something that has never been developed before. I presently have two medical device that are ready for production pending FDA registration.

        <h3>CLINICAL PRACTICE</h3>
        <p class="bio" >
          The <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Weeks-of-anguish-are-cleared-up-in-one-flip-of-2659132.php">diagnosis was organoaxial gastric rotation of the stomach</a>. Normally it's shaped like a J, but when Peter had an episode, it would flip 180 degrees, with the crook of the J facing down instead of up. It happened when his stomach was full, a helluva way to digest a meal. Luckily it always flipped back or he would have been "severely compromised," Haddad says, or worse. Relieved that it could be corrected by surgery, Simonetti had her humor back. When she first met the surgeon, Dr. Olajire Idowu, she says her opening comment was, "This isn't your first day on the job, is it?" It's a running gag and even Idowu got a laugh out of it. He's 60, and is the chair of the department of surgery at Children's. The surgery took about 90 minutes. The problem was a birth defect. The stomach is normally joined by ligaments to the spleen, diaphragm, liver and colon. The ligaments were there, but they were "loose like a rubber band," Idowu says, and wouldn't hold the stomach in place. The repair was a relatively simple operation to sew the stomach to the interior aspect of the upper abdominal wall, using permanent sutures. Peter was discharged on the Fourth of July, 2005, and within two days all his complaints while eating had stopped. That proved that "the arm flailing and the crying was pain in the stomach," Simonetti says. Fifteen months later, Peter's weight has more than doubled to a healthy 23 pounds.

        <h3>MEDICAL MISSION</h3>
        <p class="bio">
          Dr. Olajire Idowu quest is a case study of what it takes when a small group of committed doctors decides to go it alone in starting a medical nonprofit humanitarian group. The group that he and three colleagues from Children's Hospital founded, called the Medical C.A.R.E. Corporation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/17/giving/overseas-three-colleagues-help-one-doctor-on-a-mission.html">has taught surgical and other lifesaving techniques</a> to medical teams in Nigeria and in the Central American nation of Belize, American Samoa etc and has helped save the lives of several children in those countries.

          <h4>Temperature Conversion</h4>
          <p>
            This Ruby program will prompt the user for a temperature
            in degrees Celsius and let the user know what the
            corresponding temperature is in Fahrenheit.
          </p>

      <h4>Ordinal Challenge</h4>
      <p>
        This ruby program will convert a plain number
        to the ordinal of the number. So for example,
        if the user enters 2, it will display 2nd, if
        the user enters 3, it will display 3rd, etc.
